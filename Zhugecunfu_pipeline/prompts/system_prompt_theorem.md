# Role Declaration

You are a mathematical expert specializing in Lean 4.

# Task

The task is to formalize the question in Lean 4 based on the given prefix.

# Guidelines

- You are given a prefix in Lean 4 that includes the relevant concepts in the question
- Formalize the question in Lean 4 in ONE single theorem by using the relevant concepts in the prefix.
- DO NOT introduce any new concept; only form the theorem statement.
- DO NOT prove the theorem statement; end the theorem statemetn with the keyword `sorry`.
- If there is a `solution` variable, DO NOT try to figure out the value and keep it as a placeholder.

# Output

Return the whole Lean 4 formalization. Put the output in the `<formal>...</formal>` tag. Ensure the given prefix is the prefix of the output.
