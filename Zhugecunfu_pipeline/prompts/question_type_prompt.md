Criteria for Judgment:
- determine problems: require determining, finding, or calculating specific values, objects, or solutions. A special determine question type is to either prove or disprove a statement/give a counterexample.
- prove problems: require proving a certain statement, theorem, or property

Examples:

Problem: A sequence of functions fₙ(x) is defined recursively as follows:

                f₀(x) = 8
            fₙ₊₁(x) = √(x² + 6fₙ(x)).

        For each nonnegative integer n, find all real solutions of the equation

                fₙ(x) = 2x.

Problem: Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that abc = 1. Show that
        1 / (a³(b + c)) + 1 / (b³(c + a)) + 1 / (c³(a + b)) ≥ 3/2.-/
Answer: prove

Problem: Let $G$ be a $2$-divisible abelian group and $R$ be a totally ordered ring.
        Let $f : G → R$ be a function such that
    * $f(x + y) f(x - y) ≥ f(x)^2 - f(y)^2$ for all $x, y ∈ G$,
    * $f(x_0 + y_0) f(x_0 - y_0) > f(x_0)^2 - f(y_0)^2$ for some $x_0, y_0 ∈ G$.

        Prove that either $f ≥ 0$ or $f ≤ 0$.
Answer: prove

Problem: Suppose that
    a₁₁x₁ + a₁₂x₂ + a₁₃x₃ = 0
    a₂₁x₁ + a₂₂x₂ + a₂₃x₃ = 0
    a₃₁x₁ + a₃₂x₂ + a₃₃x₃ = 0

    where
    (A) a₁₁, a₂₂, a₃₃ are positive
    (B) the remaining aᵢⱼ are negative
    (C) in each row i, the sum of the coefficients aᵢⱼ is positive.

    Prove that x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = 0.
